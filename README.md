After carefully reading your code, something that would make a big difference would be using the 'MyListBoxItem' type consistently in both in your `DataSource` and your Json serialization. 



    [
      {
        "ItemColor": "Blue",
        "Message": "Blue Item"
      },
      {
        "ItemColor": "Green",
        "Message": "Green Item"
      },
      {
        "ItemColor": "Red",
        "Message": "Red Item"
      }
    ]
